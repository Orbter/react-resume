# Resume Builder (React)

## Overview
The Resume Builder is a responsive web application built with React that allows users to create, edit, and manage a resume with different sections like profile, work experience, education, skills, and languages. This project helped me expand my knowledge of React, state management, design principles, and the use of external libraries for UI enhancement.

- **State Management**: Efficient use of `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` for managing and persisting user data.

## What I Learned
This project deepened my understanding of:
- **React Fundamentals**: Implementing core concepts like component-based architecture, state management with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`), and prop handling.
- **Responsive Design**: Creating mobile-friendly layouts with CSS and improving my skills in UI/UX design.
- **State and Lifecycle Management**: Learning when and how to use `useEffect` for handling side effects and component lifecycle events, as well as `useRef` for DOM manipulation.
- **Design Tools**: Leveraging **Figma** to plan and refine the design of the interface before development.
- **External Libraries**: Integrating libraries like Quill for rich text editing and learning to style third-party components to match the projectâ€™s design.
- **Form Validation**: Handling complex form inputs with validation, especially for dates and text-based inputs like education history.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the project using **Vite** and **GitHub Pages**, with insights gained into handling deployment configurations.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the interactive UI and managing the component lifecycle.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface and ensuring a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for building functionality and handling user interactions.
- **Figma**: For wireframing and designing the UI before development.
- **Vite**: For fast development and efficient bundling.
- **GitHub Pages**: For project deployment and hosting.
- **Quill**: A rich text editor used for the description input, providing text formatting options.
